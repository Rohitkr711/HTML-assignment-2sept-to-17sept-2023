Q). Explain the difference between justify items and justify self using code examples.
Ans- In JavaScript, justify items and justify self are two CSS properties used to control the alignment of elements on a web page.The 
     justify-items property aligns items on a container's existing content, while justify-self aligns an individual element relative to
     its parent container.
     Example of justify-items and justify-self:
     .container {
       display: flex;
       justify-content: space-between;
     }
     .item {
       justify-self: center; /* align the item to the center of its parent */
     }
