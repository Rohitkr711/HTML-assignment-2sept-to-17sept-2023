Q) Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts important?
Ans-> In JavaScript, operators have precedence which determines the order in which calculations are performed. Associativity,
      on the other hand, determines if the result of an expression depends on the order of the operands. Understanding these
      concepts is crucial because it helps in writing bug-free and efficient code. Misunderstanding operator precedence and 
      associativity can lead to unexpected resultor errors in the code. It is essential to follow the standard rules for 
      operator precedence and associativity to ensure that the code behaves as intended.
