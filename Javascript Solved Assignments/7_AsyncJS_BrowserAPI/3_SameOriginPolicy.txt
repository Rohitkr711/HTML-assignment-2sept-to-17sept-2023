Q) What is the same-origin policy in the context of AJAX requests, and how can you work around it?
Ans: The same-origin policy is a security feature implemented by web browsers that prevents web pages from making requests to a different
     domain than the one it was served from. This is done to prevent data theft, malicious website attacks, and unauthorized access to 
     sensitive information. In the context of AJAX requests, the same-origin policy means that JavaScript code running on one domain cannot
     make requests to a different domain. This can cause issues when trying to access data or resources from a different domain, but there 
     are methods to work around this, such as using cross-domain requests or API gateways.
