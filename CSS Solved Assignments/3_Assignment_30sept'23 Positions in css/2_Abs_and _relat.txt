Q3. Explain the difference between Absolute and relative positioning.
Ans- Absolute positioning involves placing an element at a specific pixel position on the page, regardless of the size of the
     viewport. Relative positioning, on the other hand, involves positioning an element in relation to its parent element. In other
     words, the element's position is relative to its place on the page within its parent element, rather than a specific pixel location.
