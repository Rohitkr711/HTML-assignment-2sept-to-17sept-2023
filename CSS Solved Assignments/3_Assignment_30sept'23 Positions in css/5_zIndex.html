<!-- 
    Z-index -> In CSS, the `z-index` property is used to control the stacking order of elements on a web page. It determines the order in which elements are rendered on top of each other, with higher values appearing on top. Setting `z-index` can help you create complex, overlapping layouts and improve the overall visual hierarchy of your design.

    <p>Because the image has a z-index of -1, it will be placed behind the heading.</p>
