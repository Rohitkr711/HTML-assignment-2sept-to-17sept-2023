Q). Explain the use of Grid-auto-row and Grid-auto-column with code example.
Ans- 1. Grid-auto-rows: The grid-auto-rows property in CSS allows you to automatically distribute the available space within a grid 
        container by creating rows with a specified height or percentage of its content. This property is useful when you want to 
        create a flexible grid layout, where the rows are automatically adjusted to fit the items inside.
        Example,
        .container {
            display: grid;
            grid-auto-rows: 20px 20px;
            grid-gap: 5px;
        }


     2. Grid-auto-columns: Grid Auto Columns in CSS allow you to automatically adjust the width of columns within a grid layout based on 
        the content they contain. When used, the browser will determine the best size for each column based on its content, making the 
        layout more dynamic and responsive.
        Example,
        .container {
           display: grid;
           grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
        }
