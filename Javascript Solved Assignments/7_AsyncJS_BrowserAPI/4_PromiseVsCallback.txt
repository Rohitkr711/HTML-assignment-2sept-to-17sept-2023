Q) Compare Promises to callbacks and discuss why Promises are preferred for managing asynchronous code.
Ans: Promises and callbacks are both methods for handling asynchronous code, but they have some key differences. Promises are a more modern 
     and composer-friendly way of managing asynchronous code, allowing for cleaner and more readable code. They also return a value, which 
     can help with error handling and make it easier to work with asynchronous data. Callbacks, on the other hand, can be less composable 
     and can lead to callback hell, making the code harder to read and understand. Additionally, callbacks don't return a value, which can 
     make it more difficult to work with asynchronous data. Overall, Promises are preferred for managing asynchronous code because they are 
     more modern and cleaner.
