Q2. Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout model.
Ans. a)Justify-content: In Flexbox, the justify-content property determines how the flex items are aligned within the flex container.
                      It can be set to any of the following values: 'flex-start', 'flex-end', 'center', 'space-between', or 'space-around'.
                      Each value aligns the flex items in a different way.  
   
     b)Align-item: The 'align-item' property is used to align the flexbox items along the cross-axis (i.e., the horizontal axis in a layout
                   with rows or the vertical axis in a layout with columns). It can be used in conjunction with other alignment properties,
                   such as `align-content`, to create more complex layouts.

     c)Gap: In Flexbox, the 'gap' property is used to add space between elements. The gap can be set between elements, and it can also be
            set globally for all elements. The gap property is useful for creating separation between elements and for aligning them correctly
            within a container.

     d)Flex-direction: The 'flex-direction' sets the main axis of flex layout. It can be set to `row` or `row-reverse` to control the 
            layout direction of flex items. Changing this value can alter the layout and distribution of flex items within the container.

     e)Flex-wrap: The 'flex-wrap' property in Flexbox is used to control whether flex items are wrapped to a new line when there is not 
                  enough space on the current line to accommodate them. It can be set to 'wrap', 'nowrap', or 'initial' (the default), and
                  its value affects the behavior of the 'flex-direction' property.
