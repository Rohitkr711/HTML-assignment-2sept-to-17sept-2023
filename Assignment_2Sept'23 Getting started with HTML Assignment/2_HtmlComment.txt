Q). Explain the purpose of comments in HTML?
Ans: In HTML, comments are used to add notes or explanation within the code so a developer or programmer can read it. 
     They don't affect how the web page looks and are helpful for documentation and understanding the code and browser
     ignores it by default. Syntax of comments is "<!-- -->", and it can be apply on single line and on multiline as well.
     Shortcut key for applying comment is CTRL + '/'.

     Example - 
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
     <title>Html Comment</title>
     </head>
     <body>
     <!-- <h1>Hello Duniya</h1> -->
     <!-- <ol>
        <li>list1</li>
        <li>list2</li>
        <li>list3</li>
        <li>list4</li>
     </ol> -->

     <!-- NOTE:- ctrl + '/' is a shortcut key use for putting single and multiline comments. -->
     </body>
     </html>
