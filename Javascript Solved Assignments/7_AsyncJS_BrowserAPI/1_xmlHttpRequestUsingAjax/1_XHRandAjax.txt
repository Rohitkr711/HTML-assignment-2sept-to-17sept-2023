Q) Define XMLHttpRequest object, and How is it used in AJAX?
Ans: XMLHttpRequest, commonly known as XHR, is a programming interface for making HTTP requests from JavaScript. It is used in AJAX
    (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to allow web applications to retrieve and manipulate content on the web without reloading entire
    web pages. By using XHR, web developers can create dynamic web applications that can respond to user input and update content in 
    real-time. XHR is an object that can be used to send both GET and POST requests to web servers, and it can also be used to receive
    data in JSON or XML format. XHR is supported by all modern web browsers.
