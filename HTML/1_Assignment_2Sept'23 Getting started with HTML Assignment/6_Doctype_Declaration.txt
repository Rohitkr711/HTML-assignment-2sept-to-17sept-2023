Q). What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?

Ans: The DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML is a declaration that specifies the type of document and 
     version of HTML being used. It is required in all HTML documents and helps web browsers to
     interpret the document's structure and display it correctly. The declaration typically includes
     the words "DOCTYPE" followed by a brief description of the document's type and version, such
     as "DOCTYPE HTML".
