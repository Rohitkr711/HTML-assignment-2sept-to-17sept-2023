Q). List three ways which helps us in improving accessibility of HTML.
Ans- We can improve accessibility of through several ways:
     1. Using semantic HTML tags we can define the structure and purpose of website content, making it easier for screen readers and other 
        assistive technologies to interpret.
     2. Incorporating alternative text for images, videos, and other multimedia content, to provide a means for visually impaired users
        to understand the content.
     3. Implementing ARIA attributes to provide additional information about form controls, links, and other interactive elements, helping
        screen readers and other assistive technologies to navigate and use the website more effectively.
