Q6.Describe the purpose and usage of the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs in web development. Give suitable examples for each.
-> The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs are used in web development to store and    retrieve data on a user's device. The main difference between the two is that localStorage data persists across sessions, while sessionStorage data is cleared when the user closes their browser session. Both APIs are useful for storing user preferences, session data, and other information that needs to be accessed across multiple pages or sessions. They can be used in conjunction with other storage methods, such as cookies, to provide a more robust and flexible data storage solution for web applications.
