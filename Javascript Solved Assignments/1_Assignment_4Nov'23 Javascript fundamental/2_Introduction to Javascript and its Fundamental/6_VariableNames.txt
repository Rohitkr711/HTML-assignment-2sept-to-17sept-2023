Q) Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript. Provide an example where using a clear
   identifier improves code readability.
Ans-> Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is essential for code readability and maintainability. Variable
      names should be accurate and specific to their purpose, making it easier for other developers to understand the code. Using 
      descriptive variable names can also help prevent bugs and improve the overall quality of the code.
      An example of a clear identifier improving code readability could be naming a variable "calculatorTotal" instead of just "total",
      as it more clearly indicates the function of the variable.  

      example:
      let userName = "Rohit";
      console.log("Username =",userName);
