Q) Explain the role of operators in javascript. why are they essential in programming?
Ans-> Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform specific operations on values. They are essential in programming because they allow 
      for the manipulation and transformation of data, making it easier to write complex programs. Some common types of operators includes 
      Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
      Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) 
      Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)
      Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
      Without operators, programming would be much more difficult as we would not be able to perform basic calculations and make decisions 
      based on conditions.
